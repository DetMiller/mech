Multifaceted Exploration: Multi-Target Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the realm of penetration testing, efficiency is paramount. Kaboom-APT understands this need and answers with its multi-target specification feature. Testers can now efficiently assess a multitude of targets by defining up to 254 hosts within a C-class network. This expansion of scope enhances the tool's versatility, allowing testers to comprehensively analyze a broader attack surface.

Elevating Interaction: The New CLI Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A revamped Command Line Interface (CLI) redefines how users interact with Kaboom-APT. The CLI's intuitive design simplifies command entry and navigation, ensuring a seamless experience. This enhancement serves as a testament to Kaboom-APT's commitment to user-centric design, making it more accessible to both seasoned professionals and newcomers alike.

Precision in Discovery: Enhanced Nmap Scans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kaboom-APT's Nmap scan functionality has undergone a transformation, delivering results that are more comprehensive and precise than ever before. Testers can now glean detailed insights into open ports and services, facilitating the identification of vulnerabilities. This feature enhances the efficiency of vulnerability assessment, a cornerstone of penetration testing.

Structured Clarity: Streamlined Directory Hierarchy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Managing collected data across multiple targets is often a formidable task. Kaboom-APT has mitigated this challenge by introducing an optimized directory hierarchy. This structure not only simplifies data organization but also expedites the analysis process. The enhanced directory hierarchy underscores Kaboom-APT's commitment to efficient information management.

Automating Insights: Automatic Metasploit Research
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kaboom-APT simplifies the often intricate process of associating Metasploit modules with CVE codes. By automating this task, the tool expedites exploit identification during vulnerability assessments. This feature enhances the efficiency of the assessment phase, saving valuable time while ensuring thorough results.

Widening the Scope: Non-Canonical Port Recognition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modern networks often harbor services on non-canonical ports, deviating from traditional assignments. Kaboom-APT's non-canonical port recognition feature empowers testers to detect and assess services on such ports. This extension of coverage underscores the tool's adaptability, allowing testers to identify vulnerabilities irrespective of port assignment.

Harnessing Credentials: Efficient Credentials Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Credentials uncovered during dictionary attacks are a goldmine of information. Kaboom-APT recognizes the significance of this data and introduces a feature that allows testers to retrieve, print, and save credentials. This management feature ensures critical information is easily accessible for in-depth analysis and
